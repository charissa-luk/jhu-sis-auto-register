# 💾 JHU SIS Auto Registration Bot

This Python script automates course registration on [JHU SIS](https://sis.jhu.edu/sswf/) using Selenium. It logs in via Microsoft SSO, navigates to the registration cart, selects all classes, and clicks register at your specified time with a 10-minute pre-login buffer since SIS is slow.

---

## Features
- Logs in with your JHU Microsoft credentials
- Navigates to the registration cart
- Waits for the exact time to register
- Selects all classes and clicks "Register"
- Handles SIS slowness with retries and waits
- Interactive terminal prompts for credentials and time

---

## Requirements

- **macOS** (tested; Windows not guaranteed)
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Google Chrome** (latest version)
- **ChromeDriver** matching your Chrome version

## ⏲Sync Your Clock (macOS Only)

SIS uses the US Naval Observatory (NIST) clock. You must sync your Mac to match this time source:

1. Open **System Preferences** → **Date & Time**
2. In the **Time Server** field, click **Set** and enter your Mac password
3. Change the server from `time.apple.com` ➜ `tick.usno.navy.mil`
4. Click the lock again to save your changes

## Prevent Mac From Sleeping (Optional but Recommended)

To prevent your Mac from sleeping before registration time, install and use **Caffeine** or the built-in `caffeinate` command:

### Option A: Using Terminal (Recommended)
If it’s midnight and you want to keep the system awake until 7:30 AM (7.5 hours = 27000 seconds):
```bash
caffeinate -t 27000
```
Make sure your computer is plugged in!

### Option B: Install Caffeine App
Install with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask caffeine
```

If you're on an M1/M2/M3 Mac, note that **Rosetta 2** may be required:
```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

## Run the Bot
From the repo folder:
```bash
python sis_register.py
```

The script will prompt you for:

- 📧 **JHU email**
- 🔑 **Password**
- ⏰ **Registration time** (24-hour format, e.g., `07:00` for 7AM)

> The bot logs in **10 minutes before** the registration time and waits.

## Notes

- SIS is very slow — this bot uses long wait times (up to 2 mins per element)
- You **must** have already added classes to your Enrollment Cart
- If you use **2-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
  - The script will **not work** through the 2FA page
  - **Workaround**: log into your Microsoft account **manually** earlier that day, so 2FA won’t be triggered
 - If you encounter a **"Continue to SIS"** button after login, it's likely due to an active SIS survey.  
  → You can safely **comment out the "Continue to SIS" code block** if you don't see that page.

---

## Troubleshooting

- 🧳 Make sure **Google Chrome** and **ChromeDriver** are:
  - Fully up to date
  - Exactly the same version
